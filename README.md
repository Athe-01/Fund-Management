# Mutual Fund Portfolio Analysis
Overview

This project is a Python-based tool designed to analyze mutual fund portfolio data. It was developed as part of an internship test to showcase my ability to process and analyze financial data, implement efficient data retrieval and visualization techniques, and leverage advanced tools like Pinecone (a vector database) and Gemini (a generative AI model) for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The primary focus is on analyzing mutual fund portfolio data, identifying allocation changes, and generating insights using a combination of data processing, machine learning, and generative AI.
Project Structure

The project is divided into several key components:

   1. Data Loading and Cleaning:
    The mutual fund portfolio data is loaded from Excel files and cleaned to ensure it is structured and ready for analysis. This step is crucial because financial data often comes in unstructured or semi-structured formats, which can lead to inconsistencies. The data is split into separate tables based on row length to handle these inconsistencies,     and the cleaned tables are saved as separate Excel files for further analysis.

   2. Missing Value Analysis:
    Missing data can significantly impact the accuracy of any analysis. To address this, the project includes a module that identifies and visualizes missing values in the dataset. This helps in understanding the quality of the data and deciding how to handle missing values, whether through imputation or removal. A heatmap is generated using             seaborn to provide a clear visual representation of missing values.

   3. Allocation Change Analysis:
    Tracking changes in mutual fund allocations over time is critical for portfolio management. This component compares market values and quantities across different months to identify trends, such as increasing or decreasing investments in specific funds. The results are visualized using bar charts created with matplotlib.

   4. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):
    To provide users with detailed and context-aware insights, I implemented a RAG system. This system combines the strengths of vector databases (Pinecone) for efficient retrieval and generative AI (Gemini) for natural language responses. Document embeddings are generated using SentenceTransformer and stored in Pinecone for fast similarity search.      Gemini is then used to generate responses based on the retrieved context.

   5. Interactive Chat Interface:
    A user-friendly interface allows stakeholders to interact with the system and get insights without needing technical expertise. The command-line interface enables users to query the system and receive responses generated by Gemini based on the retrieved documents.

Why I Did What I Did - 

Data Loading and Cleaning:                           
Mutual fund portfolio data often comes in unstructured or semi-structured formats, such as Excel files with multiple tables. To ensure accurate analysis, I implemented a robust data loading and cleaning pipeline. This involved using pandas and openpyxl to read Excel files and extract tables. The raw data was split into separate tables based on row length to handle inconsistencies, and the cleaned tables were saved as separate Excel files for further analysis.
Missing Value Analysis
Missing data can lead to inaccurate analysis and insights. Identifying and visualizing missing values helps in understanding data quality and deciding how to handle missing values, whether through imputation or removal. I calculated the percentage of missing values for each column and used seaborn to create a heatmap for visualizing missing values.
Allocation Change Analysis
Tracking changes in mutual fund allocations over time is critical for portfolio management. This analysis helps identify trends, such as increasing or decreasing investments in specific funds. I compared market values and quantities across months using pandas and visualized the changes using bar charts with matplotlib.

Interactive Chat Interface
A user-friendly interface allows stakeholders to interact with the system and get insights without needing technical expertise. I built a command-line interface for querying the system and used Gemini to generate responses based on user queries and retrieved documents.

Prerequisites :                                                                                                              
To run this project, you will need Python 3.x and the following libraries: pandas, openpyxl, matplotlib, seaborn, sentence-transformers, pinecone-client, and requests.
